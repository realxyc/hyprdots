To update HyDE, you will need to pull the latest changes from GitHub and restore the configs by running the following commands:

```shell
cd ~/HyDE/Scripts
git pull
./install.sh -r
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please note that any configurations you made will be overwritten if listed to be done so as listed by `Scripts/restore_cfg.lst`.
> However, all replaced configs are backed up and may be recovered from in `~/.config/cfg_backups`.

As a second update option, you can use `Hyde restore ...`, which does have a better way of managing restore and backup options.
For more details, you can refer to [Hyde-cli - dots management wiki](https://github.com/kRHYME7/Hyde-cli/wiki/Dots-Management).
